## Installation

Use **docker-compose** in order to install the whole app and its dependencies.

Run `docker-compose up` in the project's root folder and, if everything is OK you could test the API in `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

Inside `etc/` folder there are both [Paw](https://paw.cloud) and [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) collections with some prefilled data to play with.

## ToDo

* Add user authentication.
