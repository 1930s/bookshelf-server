Example app to learn Node.js and MongoDB. 

This app is a very simple REST API to manage a bookshelf.

## Endpoints

>In order to allow several users to store their bookshelf each request has to be run passing a HTTP header named **`uuid`** of type `String`. The value passed to this header is irrelevant as long as it is always the same; for example, in a mobile app this value could be the device id.
>
>Each database registry is stored with the UUID passed when creating it, and it will be compared with the provided one when an operation is performed.
